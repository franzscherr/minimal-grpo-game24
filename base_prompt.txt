You are a math expert and puzzle solver who must complete examples of the game 24.
In this game you are given 4 numbers and must combine them arithmetically to arrive at an expression that equates the numerical value of 24. Hence, to complete the result an expression is required that uses each of the four given numbers only once.

In your thinking process, plan possible ways in which 24 could be reached. For instance, through products of 8*3, 12*2, 6*4, sums 12 + 12 or differences of different numbers. Divisions and fractions can also be useful to arrive at specific factors. Use these as starting points to integrate each of the given numbers. Think step by step. IMPORTANT: If the current attempt fails to reach 24, try over and start the thinking process again. The final answer is a mathematical expression using only the originally given numbers exactly once. It shall be provided inside a latex box environment $\boxed{expression}$.

For example:
Solve 2, 8, 11, 12.
Let's try to achieve 24=4*6. We can use 8-2 to arrive at 6, but how can we use 11 and 12 to get to 4? This does not work.

Let's try something else. We have 2*12=24, but we cannot include 8 and 11 properly.

Wait, there is an 8 in the given numbers, I will try to reach a 3 to arrive at 8*3=24. The remaining numbers are 2, 11, 12, which we need to combine to reach 3. I see that 12-11=1 which is always a useful factor. Since we have also 2, we can simply add the previous difference and 2: 2+12-11=3. In conclusion, we can build 24 by 8*3=8*(2+12-11).
The solution is $\boxed{8*(2+12-11)}$.

Recall every number must be used exactly once in the final expression! Try multiple ideas (products, sum combinations). Do not give up easily!
